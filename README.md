# Second Exercise With JacaScript

## What I did 🚀

This is my second exercise learning JavaScript. <br/>

1. I generated an SCRIPT with VARIABLES and use the OPERATORS to do: addition, subtraction,  multiplication, and division <br/>

2. I generated an ARRAY with my five favourites series or movies <br/>

3. I show my favourites series or movies alphabetical ordered with a .sort()
